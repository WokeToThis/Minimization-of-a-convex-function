# Minimization-of-a-convex-function
The concept refers to the process of finding the minimum point of a convex function of a single variable within a specific interval.
The methods used: Bisection search with/without derivatives, Golden Section search , Fibonacci search. 
3 functions were used for the simulations. Based on the simulations Fibonacci search was the most efficient method without derivative. Comments in the code explain how to reproduce the results.
